The Minimax Algorith can best be defined as a recursive function that does:
1. return a value if a terminal state is found (+10, 0 , -10)
2. go through avaiables psots on the board
3. call the minimax function on each available spot (recursion)
4. evaluate returning values from function calls
5. and return the best value
